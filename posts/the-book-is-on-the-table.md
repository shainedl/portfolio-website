A close friend of mine is from Brazil. He told me that the first sentence that English classes in Brazil teach is "The book is on the table." Therefore, he calls this sentence the "Hello, world!" of English. I want to take this opportunity to introduce my blog and personal website and have it say Hello, world! The book is on the table.

## Why am I writing this blog?
I am opinionated and give insightful advice. With a background in mentorship, I can share what I've learned from my experiences and help you find the path that's right for you. I also know that these things can be hard and want to provide an empathetic voice. For the next couple of posts I plan to advise on applying to Cornell Tech and Resume advice for entry level positions. I also want to write about things I care about like gender equality in tech. I hope you find this blog helpful and take away what's best for you!

## Best advice I didn't take
Sometimes taking helpful advice can be easier said then done. I'll get advice, agree that I should do it, but end up not following through. So, if I include this phrase in a post, it means someone gave me good advice, I didn't take it, but maybe you could benefit from it. It also serves as a reminder to take the advice that you feels right for you and don't get caught up in what others tell you what you should be doing. I haven't taken all the advice I've ever gotten even when I agreed that it would be beneficial, so it's okay if you don't want to or don't get around to following my advice.

## Intro to my website and color scheme

I've spent this week designing and building this website. Let's begin my advice with a struggle I had while designing. Best advice I somewhat didn't take: I once heard a Parsons professor say that you can't choose a color scheme based around your emotional attachments. How could she say that?! I have such an emotional attachment to pink and purple! 

The first few iterations of my website contained pastel on top of pastel on top of pastel. Looked like something a kindergardener would hand in. Then, I tried going in the opposite direction and looked up which colors were the most well-liked based on marketing and psychology. Apparently, blue is trustworthy and a favorite amongst a high percentage of people. As a complementary color, orange pairs well as an accent to blue. Blue and orange? That doesn't include pink or purple at all!

After several iterations and git commits entitled "changed the color scheme again", I settled on the one that I did. I think it's important to know your audience, but I also think that a personal website should display your personality. A close friend told me a basic practice in choosing a color scheme is to start with one color and then choose the rest of the color scheme based off that one color. So, my advice for a personal website is choose the first color that you have an emotional attachment to but don't choose all your colors based off an emotional attachment. As you can see, there is pink in this website. Sorry purple, you didn't make the cut.
